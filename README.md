# OGNİTORENKS TOOLBOX

![Tool0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OgnitorenKs/Toolbox/main/.github/EN-SS/0.png)

- OgnitorenKs Toolbox runs on x64 architectures of Windows 10 - 11 versions. It is synchronized with the latest Windows version.
- The Windows screen scaling setting may interfere with Toolbox's window setting. Scaling should be turned off when using Toolbox for smooth operation.

<details>
<B><summary> 0 - About warnings from antivirus programs</B></summary>

- Some antiviruses may report Toolbox as a virus due to the regedit registry and NSudo authorization tool.
- Online unattended installation and update tools can also be reported as viruses by antiviruses. 
- You may wonder why it detects a virus if there is no virus. Windows scripts are always detected as threats by antiviruses. When we install and update with the unattended tool, we download the updated files from the github repository, extract and delete them with the powershell command and run the program. When the antivirus evaluates this process in its algorithm, it gives a risky warning.
- The codes of my work are open. There is no encryption. You can check with peace of mind.

<B><summary> 1 - Application Installer</B></summary>

The programs in this section are selected among free applications. The All in One Runtimes section includes C++ 2005-2022 / Java / XNA Framework / OpenAL / DirectX. Other programs are detailed by categories.
- When installing some programs, we may need to install without administrator authorization. We do this authorization process with NSudo. If the program does not install, there is a problem with the UAC settings. To solve this, activate the setting in the 'Control Panel' ► 'UAC' section and restart the system. After the system is turned on, you can turn off 'UAC'.
